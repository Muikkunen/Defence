Defence 1.0 Game data

---Comments---
Types are also hard coded, meaning that they shouldn't be changed
  nor could one create new types without editing the actual code.

Data storage still on planning phase.

Information blocks are highlighted with "---".
All whitespace is completely igored BUT it is used as information divider.

Ordering of the blocks is irrelevant if not stated otherwise.
